# The unofficial iHub job API

Wouldn't it be cool if we could query the [iHub job board](https://ihub.co.ke/jobs) from the confort of a [terminal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Terminal_(macOS))? I am thinking about something like:

```
curl http://{SOME_API_ADDRESS}/api/v1/jobs
```

or better yet :point_down:

```
curl http://{SOME_API_ADDRESS}/api/v1/jobs?target=python&location=nairobi
```

and get all the open [Python](https://www.python.org/) jobs in [Nairobi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nairobi)?
