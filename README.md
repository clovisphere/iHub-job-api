# The unofficial iHub job board API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clovisphere/iHub-job-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clovisphere/iHub-job-api) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/clovisphere/iHub-job-api.svg)](https://github.com/clovisphere/iHub-job-api/issues) [![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/clovisphere/iHub-job-api.svg)](https://github.com/clovisphere/iHub-job-api/network) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/clovisphere/iHub-job-api.svg)](https://github.com/clovisphere/iHub-job-api/stargazers)




Wouldn't it be cool if we could query the [iHub job board](https://ihub.co.ke/jobs) from the confort of a [terminal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Terminal_(macOS))? I am thinking about something like:

```
curl http://{SOME_API_ADDRESS}/api/v1/jobs
```

or better yet :point_down:

```
curl http://{SOME_API_ADDRESS}/api/v1/jobs?target=python&location=nairobi
```

and get all the open [Python](https://www.python.org/) jobs in [Nairobi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nairobi)? 

I think that will be cool, and I have set out to build such an API, mostly because:

1.  The folks at [iHub](https://ihub.co.ke/) don't have an API (maybe they do.. but I didn't see any) :unamused:
2.  It's a good way to practice [Python](https://www.python.org/) :ok_hand:
3.  It's fun :joy:


### Usage
